# Overview

I developed a multiplayer combat system within unity. I wanted to bring the principles I learned in object oriented programming to life. Unity is a great way to do this.
The combat system uses the movement and control features already created in solidarity with the bullet, health, weapon, and sword attack scripts to get manage player interactions
across the server.

# Development Environment

The scripts for the project were developed in Visual studio. The application of the scripts and animation development was done in unity.
I used the photon library for multiplayer implementation of the code.
