# Overview

## UI

### design
The design of the game utilized several asset sets, character asset sets, object asset sets, input assets, and background assets. the character assets objects and input assets were obtained from free or purchased assets from Unity while the background assets were created through COPIOLET AI generation and photo manipulation. COPIOLET was prompted for various pixel art background specifications and the images were refined until they matched a desired outcome. then they were taken into a photo editor to mirror aspects of the images to make them tileable. the backgrounds were then added to scenes and further adjusted to make them distinct from the scene objects. this might involve adding color changes in Unity or returning to the photo editor to make additional changes such as hue or saturation. A key aspect was matching the color scheme of the scene assets to the background but also making the background distinct from the scene assets to allow users to make the distinction. 

the input assets such as forms buttons text inputs and fonts were made using simplePixelart asset set which is an asset of sprites and fonts that matched the design aspect of our game. In addition to the assets, some design aspects were done inside the unity editor such as color, gradients, and opacity.
